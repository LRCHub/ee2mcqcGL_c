Do you, do you, do you, do you see the light?
Do you, do you, do you, do you see the light?

Do you see the light?
You can always call my name and I'll be there

Do you, do you, do you, do you see the light?
Do you, do you, do you, do you see the light?

Life is what you make it
A choice for you, decide what to do
And love is worth a taking
A light that shines its way from me to you

I'll be looking for it, searching for it
Looking for the light
I'll be looking for it, searching for it
Looking for the light

Do you see the light shining on you?
It's coming straight to your heart
Oh, do you see the light, what can you do?
Nothing can keep us apart

Do you, do you, do you, do you see the light?
Do you, do you, do you, do you see the light?

Do you see the light?
You can always call my name and I'll be there

I'll be looking for it, searching for it
Looking for the light, do you see the light?

Do you see the light?
You can always call my name and I'll be there

I'll be looking for it, searching for it
Looking for the light, do you see the light?

Oh oh, do'y, do'y, do you, oh oh
Oh oh, do'y, do'y, do you, oh oh

Life is what you make it
A choice for you, decide what to do
And love is worth a taking
A light that shines its way from me to you

Oh oh, man, I try to live forever
I won't tell the world about this love
Oh oh, 'cause it's a choice, we'll be together
Light shine love

Do you see the light?
You can always call my name and I'll be there

I'll be looking for it, searching for it
Looking for the light, do you see the light?

Do you see the light?
You can always call my name and I'll be there

I'll be looking for it, searching for it
Looking for the light

The light
The light
The light

Do you, do you, do you, do you see the light?
Do you, do you, do you, do you see the light?

Do you see the light?
You can always call my name and I'll be there

Do you, do you, do you, do you see the light?
Do you, do you, do you, do you see the light?
